summary for chapter 5: naming
* names are used to refer to entities
* three types of names
    * an adress is the name of an access point assoc with an entity (address of an entity)
    * an identifier
        * each entity is referred to by one identifier
        * an identifier refers to only one entity
        * never assigned to another entity
    * human friendly names
    * flat naming, structure naming, and attribute based naming
* flat naming
    * need to resolve an identifier to the address of its associated enity
    * locating an entity can be done in different ways
        * broadcasting or multcasting
            * idenitifier of the entity is broadcast to every process in the distributed system
            * process offering an acces point for the entity responds  by providing
        * forwarding pointers
            * each time an entity moves to a next location it leaves behind a pointer telling where it will be next
            * locating the entity requires traversing the apth of forwarding pointers
            * reduce chains periodically
        * allocate a home to an entity
            * locating an entity proceeds by first asking the home of the current location
        * organize all nodes into a structured p2p and assign nodes to entities taking their respective identifiers into account
            * devising a routing alg by which lookup requests are moved toward the node responsible for a given entity
        * hierarchical search tree
            * network is divided into non overlapping domains
            * domains can be grouped into hight level no overlapping domains
        * lowest level director node stores teh address of the entity
        * structured names are easlity oganized in a namespace
    * name space can be represented by a naming graph in which a node represents a named entity and the label on an edge represents the name under which the entity is know
    * node having multiple outgoing edges represents a collection of entities and is also known as a context node or directory
    * large scale naming graphs is implemented by distributed its nodes across multiple name servers
* attribute based naming schems
    * (atrr, value) pairs
    * queries xan also be formulated as pairs
    * requiring exhaustive search through all the descriptors
    * such a search is feasible only when the descriptors are stored in a single data base
    * alt solution are in which pairs are mapped onto DHT based systems
    * space filling curves to evenly distribute loads
