chapter 7:  consistency and replication
* main reasons for replicating: reliability and performance
* introduces consistency problem
    * when a replica is updated the rest become different
    * solutiuon is to propgate changes such that inconsistencies are unoticed
    * severly degrade performace
* relax consistency somewhat
* difference conistency models exist
    * continuous consistency
        * set bounds to numerical deviation between replicas, staleness deviation, and deviation in the ordering of operations
    * numeral deviation refers to the value by which replicas may be different
        * application dependent
    * staleness deviation refers to the time by which a replica is considered to be consistent - despite update may taken place some time ago
        * used for web caches
    * ordering deviation refers to the max number of tentaive writes
        that may be understandint at any server without having being sync with other servers
* sequential consistency provides the semantics that programmer expect in concurrent programming
    * all writes are seen by everyone in the same order
* casual consistency
    * operatatiosn are potentially dependent on each other are carried out in order of dependency
* weaker consistency models consider a series of read and write operations
* client centric conistency models
    * do not consider the fact that data may be shared by several users
    * concentrate on consistency that an ind client should be offered
    * client connects to differet replicas on the course of the lifetime
    * when a client connects to a new replica the replica shoudl have the most up to date data that had been manipulated by the user
        * which may reside at the previous location
* propogating updates
    * difference  techniques can be applied
        * what is propogated versus whwer updates are propogated and by whom
* not every replica needs  to be  updated immediatly
    * depends on the distribution protocol
    * whether updates are pushed to other replicas or that a replica pulls in updates from other replicas
* consistency protocols descibe specific implemet of consistency models
* primary based protocols versus replicated write protocols
    * primary based protocols all update operations are forwarded tro a primary copt that sub seqeuently ensure the update is properly order and forwarded
    * replicated write protocols an update is forwarded to several replcis at the same time.
* caching content
    * write through versus write back
