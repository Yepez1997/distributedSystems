chapter 9 : security:
* ds should allow different security policies to be enforced
* three important issues to be considered
    * ds should offer fauclities to establish secure channels between processes
        * mutually authentication the communicating parties and protect against tampering their transmission
        * provides confidentiality so that no one but the communicating parties can read the messages that go through the channel
* use symetric cryptosystem or combine it with public key system
* session keys for longterm
* second issue to be considered
    * access control or authorization
        * autheri deals with protecting resources in such a wasy that only processes that have the proper acess rights can actual access and use those resources
        * always takes place after a process has been authenticated
        * denial or service (rate limit ...)
    * two ways of implmenting access control
        * each resource maintains an ac list listing each rights o each user or process
        * a process can carry a certifcate stating  precicely whta its rights are for part set of resources
        * cert benifit - a ticket can easily pass its ticket to another process and pass its access rights
    * dealing wiht ac in mobile code
        * sandboxes
* third issue to be considered
    * concerns management
    * key management and authorization
        * km includes distribution of crytographic keys
        * auth managment are attr certificates and delegation
* handling secure names
    * name an object by taking the hash of its pk along with a human readable label
