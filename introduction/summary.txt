summary for chapter 1: introduction
* distributed systems consist of autonomous computers that works together and act as a single coherant system
* middleware allows the combination of collective and independent behavior
* middleware is the sofyware layer placed between operating systems and distributed applications
* protocols for those include communication, transactions, service composition, and reliablity
* sharing resources and ensuring openess
* distribution transparency comes with a performance price and is intended to hide many of the processes and data that happen in the distributed processes
* trade offs between difference forms of distrubution transparcy inhereted can complicate understanding
* scalability does not always blend with distrubtion transparency
    * geographic scalabilty - hiding latencies and bandwidth may be
    difficult
* many developers make assumptions about the network that are fundamentally wrong
    * network is low latency
    * network is secure
    * network is homogenous
    * network is reliable
* distributed computing systems are typically deployed for high performance applications
    * often originating from parrallel computing
