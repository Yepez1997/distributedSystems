summary for chapter 2: architecutures
* distributed systems can be organized in a plethora of ways and we can make a distinction between software architecture and system architecture
* system architectures consider where components are placed across various machines
* software architectures are more concerned about the logical organization of the software. in other words how the components interact, how they are structured, how they are made independent, etc etc
* when talking about architectures it is critical to consider architectural style
* architectural style has the basic princple that is followed in the organization between software components in a distributed system
* some styles include
    * layering architecture
    * object based styles
    * resource based styles
    * event based architeture
* there are many different types of organzizations involved
    between the client and the server
    * client-server architecture
* by placing different components on different machines we obtain a natural physical distribution of functiosn acorss a collection of machines.
* client server architectures are highly centralized
* in decentralized architectures equal role is played amongst the proccesses and can commonly be referred to peer to peer systems
* in peer to peer systems procceses are organized in an overlay network, which is a logical network in every porcess has a local list of other peers that it can commicate with
* overlay network can be structured
    * deterministic schemes can be employed for routing messages between proccesses
* can be unstructures
    * the list of peers is more or less random
    * search algorithms need to be employed for locating data
        * flood and gossip based searching
* hybrid architectures
    * formed from elements of decentralized and centralized organizations
    * centralized component to handle to inital request
    * then redirect to a client based replica server
        * which may be part of a p2p network
